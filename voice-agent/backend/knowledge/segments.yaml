      For MSME business owners with Rs 5 lakh+ gold loans.

      Key Pain Points:
      - High interest eating into working capital
      - Need flexible access to funds
      - Value time - can't visit branch repeatedly
      - Want relationship, not just transaction

      Kotak Value Proposition:
      - Rate: 9.5% starting (vs 18-24% at NBFCs)
      - Savings: Rs 40,000-80,000 annually on Rs 5-10 lakh loan
      - Top-up facility up to 75% LTV
      - Overdraft option - use what you need
      - Dedicated relationship manager

      Pitch Approach:
      "As a business owner, you understand numbers. Let me show you the math.

      Your current loan: Rs ___ at ___% = Rs ___ annual interest
      Kotak loan: Rs ___ at 9.5% = Rs ___ annual interest
      Annual savings: Rs ___

      That's working capital freed up for your business growth.

      Plus, with our overdraft facility, you only pay interest on what you use.

      Would you like me to calculate your exact savings?"
