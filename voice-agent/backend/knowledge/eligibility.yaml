      Understanding how we value your gold for the loan.

      Valuation Process:
      1. You bring gold to branch (in your presence)
      2. Gold tested for purity using XRF machine (non-destructive)
      3. Gold weighed on precision scale
      4. Today's gold rate applied
      5. Loan amount calculated (up to 75% of value)

      Valuation Formula:
      Loan Amount = Gold Weight x Purity Factor x Gold Rate x 75%

      Example:
      - Gold weight: 100 grams
      - Purity: 22K (factor: 0.916)
      - Gold rate: Rs 7,500/gram
      - Market value: 100 x 0.916 x 7,500 = Rs 6,87,000
      - Max loan (75% LTV): Rs 5,15,250

      Purity Factors:
      - 24K: 1.00 (pure gold)
      - 22K: 0.916
      - 20K: 0.833
      - 18K: 0.750

      Important:
      - Stones deducted from weight (you keep them or we safekeep)
      - Making charges not considered (only gold value)
      - Rate based on IBJA (India Bullion Jewellers Association)

      Valuation is FREE and takes only 15 minutes.

  # =============================================================================
  # LTV EXPLAINED
  # =============================================================================
  - id: elig_ltv_001
    title: "Loan-to-Value (LTV) Explained"
    content: |
      LTV determines how much loan you can get against your gold.

      What is LTV:
      Loan-to-Value ratio is the percentage of gold's market value you can borrow.

      Current LTV at Kotak:
      - Standard: Up to 75%
      - Means: Rs 75 loan for every Rs 100 gold value

      Why Not 100%:
      - RBI regulation caps LTV at 75%
      - Protects both bank and customer
      - Cushion against gold price fluctuations

      LTV Example:
      - Your gold value: Rs 10 lakh
      - Maximum loan at 75% LTV: Rs 7.5 lakh

      What Affects Your LTV:
      - Gold purity (higher = better)
      - Gold type (jewelry may have lower LTV than bars)
      - Loan product (overdraft may have 70% LTV)

      RBI 2025 Rules (Coming April 2026):
      - 12-month bullet loans: 75% LTV
      - 12-24 month loans: 80% LTV
      - 24-36 month loans: 85% LTV

      Kotak already compliant with new rules.
