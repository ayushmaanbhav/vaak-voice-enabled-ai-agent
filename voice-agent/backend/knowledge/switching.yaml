    title: "7-Day Bridge Loan for Switching"
    content: |
      The biggest barrier to switching is: "I don't have cash to close my existing loan."

      Our Solution: 7-Day Bridge Loan

      How It Works:
      1. Apply at Kotak branch (bring ID, existing loan documents)
      2. Kotak pre-approves your new gold loan
      3. We give you a 7-day bridge loan at ZERO interest
      4. Bridge loan amount sent directly to your old lender
      5. You redeem your gold (we help with insured transit)
      6. Gold pledged at Kotak within 7 days
      7. Bridge loan converts to regular gold loan

      Key Features:
      - Interest-free for 7 days
      - Amount: Up to your expected new loan amount
      - No separate collateral needed
      - Direct payment to old lender (no cash in your hands)

      Your Out-of-Pocket: Rs 0 (Zero)

      Example:
      - Your existing loan with Muthoot: Rs 5 lakh
      - Kotak bridge loan: Rs 5 lakh (sent to Muthoot)
      - You redeem gold, bring to Kotak
      - New Kotak loan: Rs 5 lakh at 10% (replaces bridge)

      This is unique to Kotak - no other bank offers this.
