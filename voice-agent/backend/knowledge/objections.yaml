    title: "Objection: Your rate seems high"
    objection_type: rate
    trigger_phrases: ["rate is high", "too expensive", "rate zyada", "mehnga", "cheaper elsewhere"]
    content: |
      Customer says rate is high or expensive.

      Empathetic Response:
      "I understand rate is an important factor. Let me share the complete picture.

      Our rate of 10% may look similar to what you see elsewhere, but consider this:
      - No hidden charges that add up later
      - Zero foreclosure penalty - repay early and save
      - Transparent processing - no surprises

      Real Comparison (Rs 5 lakh loan, 12 months):
      - Other lenders at 18%: You pay Rs 90,000 interest + Rs 15,000 hidden fees
      - Kotak at 10%: You pay Rs 50,000 interest + Rs 5,000 processing
      - Your net savings: Rs 50,000

      Would you like me to calculate the exact savings for your loan amount?"

      Key Points:
      - Acknowledge their concern first
      - Shift focus from rate to total cost
      - Quantify savings with real numbers
      - Offer personalized calculation

      Customer kehta hai rate zyada hai.

      Response:
      "Main samajhta/samajhti hoon rate important hai. Poori picture dekhiye.

      Hamare 10% rate mein koi hidden charges nahi hain:
      - Prepayment free hai - jaldi repay karein, byaaj bachayein
      - Processing fee transparent hai
      - No surprises baad mein

      Comparison (Rs 5 lakh loan):
      - Dusre lenders 18% pe: Rs 90,000 byaaj + Rs 15,000 hidden
      - Kotak 10% pe: Rs 50,000 byaaj + Rs 5,000 processing
      - Aapki bachat: Rs 50,000

      Aapke loan amount pe exact calculation karoon?"

    objection_type: loyalty
    trigger_phrases: ["happy", "satisfied", "relationship", "know me", "loyal"]
    content: |
      Customer is loyal to current lender.

      Response:
      "That's great that you have a good relationship. Loyalty matters.

      But let me ask you this - is your loyalty being rewarded?
      - Are you getting their best rate after years of relationship?
      - Have they reduced your rate when market rates fell?
      - Do they call you with better offers proactively?

      At Kotak, we believe loyalty should work both ways:
      - Existing Kotak customers get 0.5% lower rate
      - Dedicated relationship manager from day one
      - Priority service - you're not just another account
      - All your banking in one place

      You can continue your relationship there, but also explore what Kotak can offer. There's no commitment in just checking your options.

      Would you like to see how much you could save while getting premium service?"

      Key Points:
      - Respect their loyalty
      - Plant seed of doubt about value received
      - Position Kotak relationship as upgrade
      - Low-pressure next step

      Customer has trust concerns.

      Response:
      "I appreciate your honesty. Trust has to be earned, not assumed.

      Let me share why Kotak is different:

      Our Track Record:
      - Zero RBI violations ever in gold loan business
      - Zero cases of gold loss or misplacement
      - Operating since 1985 - 40 years of trust

      Compare with Industry:
      - IIFL was banned by RBI for 6 months (2024)
      - Muthoot paid Rs 27.5 lakh in penalties
      - Manappuram faced multiple violations

      What We Do Differently:
      - Customer present during gold valuation (you watch)
      - Video recording of entire process
      - Real-time tracking through app
      - 30-day notice before any auction (not 1 day like some)

      Customer Reviews:
      - 4.2/5 rating on Google
      - 'Transparent and professional' - most common feedback

      I don't expect you to trust us blindly. Visit our branch, see our vaults, talk to our team. Then decide.

      Would you like to schedule a branch visit?"

      Key Points:
      - Acknowledge trust must be earned
      - Use facts and track record
      - Contrast with competitor issues subtly

      Customer prefers Muthoot Finance.

      Response:
      "Muthoot is certainly well-known with many branches. They've been in business long.

      But let me share some facts for your consideration:

      Rate Comparison:

      - Kotak at 10%: Rs 50,000 interest
      - You save: Rs 40,000

      Other Differences:
      - Kotak: Bank-grade vaults (RBI regulated)
      - Muthoot: NBFC vaults (different standards)

      - Kotak: Zero foreclosure charges
      - Muthoot: May charge penalty for early closure

      - Kotak: Relationship with your bank
      - Muthoot: Separate relationship to manage

      Customer reviews mention Muthoot has 2.19/5 rating on MouthShut due to service issues.

      I'm not saying switch blindly - just compare the numbers. What matters more to you - the familiarity or the savings?"

      - Customer complaints about Rs 75,000 stuck for 10 days
      - Kotak 811: 20 million users, proven reliability

      - Kotak at 10%: Rs 50,000 interest
      - You save: Rs 55,000

      That's over Rs 4,500 per month back in your pocket.
