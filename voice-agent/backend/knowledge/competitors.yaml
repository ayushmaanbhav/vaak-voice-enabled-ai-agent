      Detailed comparison: Kotak vs IIFL Finance.

      Important Note:

      - Inadequate due diligence
      - LTV limit violations
      - 6 lakh customers affected
      - New gold loans stopped for 6 months

      Interest Rate:
      - IIFL: 11% to 24% per annum
      - Kotak: 9.5% to 11.5% per annum

      Current Status:

      - But regulatory concerns remain in market

      Why This Matters:

      - Uncertainty about gold safety

      Kotak Comparison:
      - Zero RBI violations ever
