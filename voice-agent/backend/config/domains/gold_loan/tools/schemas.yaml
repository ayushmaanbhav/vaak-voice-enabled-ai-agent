# Tool usage guidelines for the LLM
usage_guidelines:
  general: |
    Only use tools when the customer's request requires specific calculations or data lookup.
    For general conversation, respond naturally without tools.

  eligibility: |
    Use check_eligibility when customer asks about loan amount they can get,
    or wants to know if they qualify for a gold loan.

  savings: |
    Use calculate_savings when customer mentions their current lender and rate,
    or asks how much they would save by switching.

  branches: |
    Use find_branches when customer asks about branch locations or wants to visit.

  callback: |
    Use schedule_callback when customer requests a callback or wants to be contacted.

  lead_capture: |
    Use capture_lead at conversation end when customer shows interest and provides contact info.
