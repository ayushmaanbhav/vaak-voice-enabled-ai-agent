//! Stage-Based Dialog Management
//!
//! Manages conversation stages and transitions for sales conversations.
//!
//! ## Domain Agnosticism
//!
//! This module provides generic stage management for any sales domain.
//! Domain-specific guidance and questions come from config via `StageConfigProvider`.
//! The enum values (Greeting, Discovery, etc.) are generic sales stages.
