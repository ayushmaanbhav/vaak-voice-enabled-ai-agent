speaker_notes: |
  **Opening**: "This is Muthoot Finance. Rs 1.09 lakh crore portfolio. 38% market share. And a customer trust crisis that's getting worse every quarter."

  **Market Position Context**:
  - Largest gold loan NBFC in India
  - More than 3X the size of nearest competitor
  - 5,000+ branches across India
  - But scale ≠ trust

  **RBI Penalty Analysis**:
  "Let's look at the regulatory track record. Rs 27.5 lakh in penalties over 5 years."
  - 2020: Rs 10 lakh - LTV violations, PAN failures (basic compliance!)
  - 2020-2023: Rs 1.9 lakh - KYC non-compliance (know your customer!)
  - Jan 2025: Rs 2.7 lakh - Customer complaints mishandled
  - 2023-2024: Rs 7.9 lakh - Financial disclosure violations (transparency!)
  - 2024: Rs 5 lakh - Corporate governance failures

  "This isn't one-off. This is PATTERN. Systemic failure to meet basic regulatory standards."

  **Fraud Crisis**:
  "Now the fraud cases. Rs 22+ crore in active investigations."

  - **Gift Card Fraud (Feb 2025)**: Rs 11.92 crore
    - Senior management involved
    - CEO suspended during investigation
    - Leadership crisis at worst possible time

  - **ED Money Laundering Probe**: Rs 10.2 crore
    - Enforcement Directorate investigating PMLA violations
    - Multiple locations under scanner

  - **Kerala Branch Scam**: Rs 50+ lakh
    - Employee-customer collusion
    - Fraudulent loan disbursements

  **Customer Voice Analysis**:
  "But here's what really matters. What customers are saying. 2,943 reviews on MouthShut. 2.19 out of 5 stars. 47% gave ONE star."

  Read each quote with emotion:
  1. **Auction Terror**: "One day delay. They auctioned grandmother's gold."
  2. **Inflexible Recovery**: "Rejected Rs 50K payment, demanded full Rs 2L"
  3. **Digital Failure**: "App fails, then they charge YOU penalty"
  4. **Hidden Charges**: "12% became 18% without notice"
  5. **Security Nightmare**: "Gold valued in 30 seconds on dirty table"
  6. **Service Arrogance**: "23 days to return gold. No apology."

  **The Comparison**:
  "Let's be direct. Muthoot vs Kotak."
  - Customer rating: 2.19 vs bank-grade trust ✓
  - RBI penalties: Rs 27.5 lakh vs ZERO ✓
  - Fraud: Rs 22+ Cr vs bank security ✓
  - Leadership: CEO suspended vs stable ✓
  - Service: 47% hate vs Kotak 811 experience ✓

  **The Opportunity**:
  "Muthoot has 38% market share. That's Rs 1.09 lakh crore in customer relationships. But how many are happy? How many are waiting for a better option? How many would switch to a bank they already trust if we just asked them?"

  **Closing**: "Their scale is their vulnerability. Every penalty, every fraud case, every 1-star review is a customer looking for a way out. And we're the exit door."

  **Transition**: "Muthoot isn't alone. Let's look at Manappuram..."
