speaker_notes: |
  **Opening**: "Let me show you the empire we're up against. And why it's vulnerable."

  **Market Share Context**:
  - Muthoot alone controls 38% - Rs 1.09 lakh crore portfolio
  - Top 3 NBFCs = 63% market share
  - This isn't a fragmented market. It's an oligopoly.

  **The Contradiction**:
  - Massive scale + terrible customer experience
  - Market dominance + regulatory violations
  - Brand recognition + trust erosion

  **Muthoot Deep Dive**:
  - 2.19/5 stars on MouthShut (2,943 reviews!)
  - Customers report gold auctioned for single-day delays
  - Feb 2025: CEO suspended in Rs 11.92 Cr gift card fraud
  - RBI penalties every year: LTV, KYC, complaints, governance

  **Manappuram Reality**:
  - Asirvad microfinance subsidiary BANNED by RBI (Oct 2024)
  - Stock fell 14% in response
  - Rs 20 Cr fraud discovered only due to IT outage
  - Rs 43 lakh fake gold scam (UP, Feb 2025)
  - One branch had ZERO security guards with 30kg gold!

  **IIFL Crisis**:
  - March 2024: RBI banned all gold loan disbursements
  - 6 critical violations
  - Stock crashed 20% in single day
  - Took 5 months to partially resume operations

  **The Opportunity**:
  "These players have scale. But they've broken customer trust. They've violated RBI rules. They've prioritized growth over governance. And that creates a massive window for a bank that does it right."

  **Transition**: "Let's look at each crisis in detail. Starting with the market leader..."
