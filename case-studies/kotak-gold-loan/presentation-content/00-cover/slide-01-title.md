# Speaker Notes
speaker_notes: |
  Welcome to the presentation on Kotak's strategic opportunity in the gold loan market.

  **Opening Hook:**
  "Good morning. Today we're discussing a Rs 7.1 lakh crore market where our customers are currently paying 18-24% interest to NBFCs like Muthoot and Manappuram - when we can serve them at 10-11%."

  **Key Setup Points:**
  - This is not about entering gold loans from scratch - we already have the product
  - This is about aggressive acquisition of our own customers who are using competitors
  - The opportunity: 53 million Kotak customers, estimated 8-12% have active gold loans with NBFCs
  - The math: If they're paying 22% and we charge 11%, they save 50% on interest
  - This presentation is based on 18 research reports spanning 7 threads, including global best practices

  **Tone:**
  Start confidently. This is a massive, proven market with clear customer pain points we can solve.

  **Transition:**
  "Before we dive into strategy, let me introduce you to one of our customers..."
