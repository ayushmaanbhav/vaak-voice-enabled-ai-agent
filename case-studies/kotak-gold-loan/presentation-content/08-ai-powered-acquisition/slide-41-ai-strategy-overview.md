# Three AI Solutions. One Goal: Acquisition Excellence.

## AI Acquisition Portfolio

| AI Solution | Investment | Priority | Expected Impact |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Computer Vision App Appraisal** | Rs 5 Cr | **CRITICAL** | **80% conversion lift** |
| **Predictive Acquisition Model** | Rs 2.5 Cr | **CRITICAL** | **16x campaign conversion** |
| **Personalized Pitching Engine** | Rs 1.5 Cr | **EXPERIMENTAL** | **7x offer acceptance** |

## Year 1 Investment Breakdown

### Core Acquisition AI
- **Critical Systems**: Rs 9 Cr
  - Computer Vision App Appraisal: Rs 5 Cr
  - Predictive Acquisition Model: Rs 2.5 Cr
  - Personalization Engine (Phase 1): Rs 1.5 Cr

### Mandatory Compliance AI
- **LTV Monitoring System**: Rs 1.5 Cr (RBI compliance)
- **Fraud Detection Engine**: Rs 2 Cr (risk management)

### Total AI Investment (Year 1)
**Rs 13 Cr** (Rs 9 Cr acquisition + Rs 3.5 Cr compliance + Rs 0.5 Cr infrastructure)

## Strategic Rationale

### Why These Three?

**Computer Vision** - Removes biggest friction point
- 80% of gold loan customers abandon at "value uncertainty" stage
- App-based estimation builds confidence → branch visits increase 45%
- Same-day disbursement becomes possible

**Predictive Model** - Finds hidden customers
- 53M Kotak customers, but which have competitor gold loans?
- Transaction pattern analysis identifies 8-10 lakh high-propensity leads
- 16x improvement in campaign conversion efficiency

**Personalization Engine** - Right offer, right time
- Phase 1 (rule-based): Low-risk, proven approach
- Phase 2/3 contingent on Phase 1 success
- 7x improvement in offer acceptance rates

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### CRITICAL vs EXPERIMENTAL Classification

**CRITICAL Systems** (Must Deploy)
- Computer Vision: Proven ROI, competitor already using
- Predictive Model: Core to acquisition strategy

**EXPERIMENTAL System** (Contingent Deployment)
- Personalization Engine Phase 1: Test with Rs 1.5 Cr
- If 5% conversion lift achieved → proceed to Phase 2/3
- If unsuccessful → reallocate budget to proven systems

## Success Metrics (12-Month Targets)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Gold loan applications | 50K/year | 150K/year | **3x** |
| Application to disbursement | 25% | 40% | **+60%** |
| Campaign conversion | 0.12% | 2% | **16x** |
| Customer acquisition cost | Rs 2,000 | Rs 500 | **-75%** |
| Time to disbursement | 4-6 hours | 90 minutes | **-65%** |
