## Stage 1: Awareness (1,000,000 → 50,000)

### Goal
Get on the customer's radar as a viable gold loan alternative

### Tactics by Channel

**Digital Campaigns (600K reach)**
- Google Ads: "gold loan", "Muthoot alternative", "lowest gold loan rate"
- Facebook/Instagram: Lookalike audiences based on competitor payment patterns
- YouTube: Pre-roll ads on financial literacy channels

**App Notifications (200K reach)**
- Push to Kotak 811 users with propensity score 75+
- Banner in-app for savings account holders with competitor NEFT patterns

**RM Outreach (100K reach)**
- Personalized emails to Premier/Privy League customers
- Subject line: "Save Rs X/month on your existing gold loan"

**BC/Branch (100K reach)**
- SHG presentations by BC agents (Shakti Gold)
- Branch posters and counter-top collateral

### Conversion Trigger
**5% engagement rate** (50,000 customers take next action)

### Drop-Off Analysis
- 95% don't engage: Message mismatch, low awareness, satisfied with current lender
- **Optimization Focus**: A/B test messaging, improve offer clarity, test new channels

---

## Stage 2: Interest (50,000 → 10,000)

### Goal
Generate genuine interest and move customer to consideration

### Customer Actions

**Landing Page Visits (30,000)**

- Scroll depth: 60% view full page
- Key content: Rate comparison, eligibility calculator, customer testimonials

**Savings Calculator Usage (15,000)**

- Output: "You'll save Rs X/month, Rs Y/year by switching to Kotak"
- Conversion uplift: 3x higher for calculator users vs non-users

**Branch Inquiries (5,000)**
- Walk-ins after seeing ads/posters
- Appointment bookings via website/app
- Call center inquiries (1800 number)

### Conversion Trigger
**20% move to consideration** (10,000 customers start application)

### Drop-Off Analysis
- 80% don't proceed: Lack of urgency, hassle perception, competitor loyalty
- **Optimization Focus**: Reduce friction (instant pre-approval), add urgency (limited-time offer), build trust (video testimonials)

---

## Stage 3: Consideration (10,000 → 1,500)

### Goal
Convert interest into loan application and commitment

### Customer Actions

**Pre-Approval Requests (7,000)**
- **Digital Path**: In-app form with KYC auto-populated → Instant eligibility + rate
- **Offline Path**: Branch visit → RM discussion → Pre-approved offer letter
- **Time to Pre-Approval**: 5 minutes (digital), 1 hour (branch)

**Branch Appointments (2,000)**
- Scheduled via app/website/call center
- RM prepares personalized offer sheet (current loan details + Kotak offer)

### Conversion Trigger
**15% convert to customers** (1,500 customers disburse loan)

### Drop-Off Analysis

- **Optimization Focus**: Bridge loan to eliminate cash flow gap, doorstep gold collection, competitor payoff coordination
