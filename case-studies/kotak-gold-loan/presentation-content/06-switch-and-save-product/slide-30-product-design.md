  Switch & Save is designed specifically for existing Kotak customers who currently have gold loans with competitors. This is a highly targeted product that focuses on customers where we already have trust and relationship history.

  The minimum amount of Rs 3 lakh is strategic - below this threshold, the absolute savings don't justify the friction of switching, even with our bridge loan. We want high-intent customers who will appreciate the value.

  The interest rate of 9.5-10.5% p.a. represents a massive 40-50% reduction compared to typical NBFC rates of 16-24%. This creates compelling monthly savings.

  Zero processing fees for balance transfers remove a major friction point. Customers switching from NBFCs are used to paying 1-3% in fees.

  The 24-month rate lock is crucial for creating stickiness. Customers know their rate won't increase even if market rates rise, giving them peace of mind and reducing the temptation to shop around later.

  Cashback of Rs 1,000-3,000 for larger loans provides immediate gratification and offsets any minor inconveniences during switching.
