  This slide breaks down the exact 3-day process so customers can visualize how smooth this really is.

  Day 0 starts when the customer shows interest - either through app, website, branch visit, or RM outreach. Because they're an existing Kotak customer, we can issue a pre-approval instantly. No paperwork, no waiting, no uncertainty. They know they're approved before they even start.

  Day 1 is when the magic happens. We sanction the bridge loan - the exact amount needed to close their NBFC loan. We transfer the funds directly to Muthoot/Manappuram/IIFL. The customer doesn't handle any money. They just get a notification: "Your Muthoot loan has been closed by Kotak."

  Day 2-3, the customer goes to Muthoot/Manappuram to redeem their gold. Here's where our insured transit service kicks in. Instead of carrying Rs 5 lakh worth of gold themselves, they use our professional service. Cost is Rs 100-200, which we absorb. Full insurance, professional handling, zero customer anxiety.

  Day 3, they bring the gold to Kotak branch. We value it, pledge it, and replace the bridge loan with the full gold loan at 9.5-10.5%. The bridge loan disappears, the customer is now a Kotak gold loan customer, and they're saving Rs 2,000-5,000 per month.

  Total customer cost during this entire process: Rs 0. Total time: 3 days. This is why it works.

## FAQs: Customer Concerns Addressed

### "What if the gold value is less than my NBFC loan amount?"
**ANSWER**: We verify expected gold value before sanctioning bridge loan. If there's a shortfall (rare), you have two options:
1. Pay the difference (small amount, e.g., Rs 10K-20K on Rs 5L loan)
2. Cancel the switch - bridge loan is reversed, no penalty (extremely rare scenario)

**Reality**: 95%+ of cases, gold value exceeds NBFC loan (gold prices rise over time)

---

### "What happens if I don't bring the gold within 7 days?"
**ANSWER**: Bridge loan has 7-day interest-free period. If you don't complete by Day 7:
- Day 8-14: Interest applies at normal gold loan rate (9.5-10.5%)
- Day 15: Amount auto-debited from Kotak account (you signed authorization)

**Reality**: 95%+ complete within 3 days. Kotak provides proactive reminders + support.

---

### "Can I back out after accepting the bridge loan?"
**ANSWER**: Yes, until Day 1 disbursement. After disbursement:
- You must complete the switch OR
- Repay bridge loan within 7 days (no interest if within 7 days)
- Auto-debit from Kotak account applies if not repaid

**Reality**: <2% cancellation rate after bridge loan acceptance (high intent customers)

---

### "Is the gold safe during transit?"
**ANSWER**: Absolutely. Kotak's insured transit service includes:
- Full value insurance (Rs 3L-1Cr coverage)
- Professional logistics partner (trained personnel)
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Zero customer liability
- Cost absorbed by Kotak (Rs 100-200)

**Reality**: 99.9%+ transit success rate. Zero customer loss incidents.

---

### "How do I know my NBFC loan is really closed?"
**ANSWER**: You receive:
1. NBFC closure certificate (same day)
2. SMS from NBFC confirming loan closed
3. Gold release authorization from NBFC
4. Kotak confirmation with payment reference

**Reality**: Direct bank-to-bank payment eliminates errors. 100% transparency.
