  This slide is about being smart with incentives - understanding what actually drives switching behavior vs what's just wasted money.

  Our research shows that the highest ROI incentive is the 7-day interest-free bridge loan. It costs us only Rs 200-300 in float, but delivers Rs 2,000-10,000 in perceived value because it solves the biggest friction point - the cash flow gap. This is VERY HIGH effectiveness.

  Processing fee waiver is also HIGH effectiveness - costs us nothing (just absorbed margin), but customers perceive Rs 3,000-15,000 in value because it's a tangible upfront saving.

  Transit insurance is HIGH effectiveness - costs us Rs 100-200, but eliminates massive anxiety about safety during gold movement. It's not about the money, it's about peace of mind.

  Rate lock for 24 months is MEDIUM effectiveness - there's some margin risk if rates rise, but it creates stickiness and reduces future churn. Worthwhile strategic investment.

  Now, LOW ROI incentives to AVOID: Generic cashback without conditions attracts deal-seekers who churn as soon as they get the money. Gift cards have no connection to our value proposition. Lucky draws dilute our serious banking positioning - we're not a lottery.

  The incentive-by-segment matrix shows how we customize offers. P1 high-value customers get Rs 10K-15K total (zero fees + rate lock + bridge), but they're Rs 10L+ loans with Rs 100K+ lifetime value. P2 trust-seekers value insurance and transparency. P3 women appreciate safety features. P4 young customers want instant gratification.

  Smart incentives are about understanding customer psychology and addressing specific friction points, not just throwing money at acquisition.

# Smart Incentives That Work

## ROI-Driven Incentive Strategy for Gold Loan Switching

---

## Incentive Philosophy: Friction Removal > Generic Discounts

### Core Principle
**Invest in removing friction points, not in discounts that attract low-quality customers.**

The best incentives:
1. **Address specific pain points** (cash flow gap, safety anxiety, uncertainty)
2. **Create disproportionate perceived value** vs actual cost to Kotak
3. **Attract high-intent customers** who value solutions, not just deals
4. **Drive completion, not just application** (reduce drop-offs)
5. **Build loyalty, not transaction behavior** (stickiness, not churn)

### What We Learned
- **60-70% of switching failures** are due to cash flow gap (need Rs 3-10L upfront)
- **20-30% of failures** are due to gold transit anxiety
- **Generic cashback** attracts deal-seekers who churn post-cashback
- **Friction-solving incentives** attract quality customers with high lifetime value

---

## HIGH ROI Incentives (RECOMMENDED)

### 1. 7-Day Interest-Free Bridge Loan
**VERY HIGH Effectiveness**

#### Friction Addressed
- **Cash flow gap**: Customer needs Rs 3-10L upfront to close NBFC loan
- **Borrowing embarrassment**: Avoid asking family for temporary funds
- **Credit card expense**: Avoid 18-36% interest on cash advances
- **Investment liquidation**: Avoid exit loads and market timing risk

#### Customer Value Perception
- **Perceived Saving**: Rs 2,000-10,000 (7-14 days of avoided borrowing costs)
- **Convenience Value**: Priceless (eliminates primary switching barrier)
- **Psychological Relief**: Massive (from "impossible" to "effortless")

#### Actual Cost to Kotak
- **Float Cost**: ~Rs 200-300 per Rs 5L bridge (7-day opportunity cost at 3% p.a. net margin)
- **Risk Cost**: Minimal (existing Kotak customer + gold security + auto-debit authorization)
- **Processing Cost**: Rs 50-100 (workflow management)
- **Total Cost**: Rs 250-400 per switch

#### ROI Analysis
```
Customer Value:         Rs 5,000-10,000 (perceived)
Kotak Cost:             Rs 250-400
Value-to-Cost Ratio:    12.5x - 40x
Effectiveness:          VERY HIGH
Conversion Impact:      +70% completion rate (40% → 75%)
```

#### Why It Works
- Solves the #1 barrier to switching (60-70% drop-off point)
- Unique to Kotak (no competitor offers this)
- Creates "wow" moment ("They actually closed my NBFC loan!")
- Attracts serious switchers, not deal-seekers
- Drives word-of-mouth ("You won't believe what Kotak did...")

---

### 2. Processing Fee Waiver (Zero Fees for Balance Transfers)
**HIGH Effectiveness**

#### Friction Addressed
- **Upfront cost**: Typical processing fee is 1-3% (Rs 3K-30K on Rs 3L-10L)
- **Switching cost perception**: "I have to pay to save money?"
- **Comparison paralysis**: "New lender charges 2%, old one didn't"

#### Customer Value Perception
- **Perceived Saving**: Rs 3,000-30,000 (depends on loan size)
- **Tangible Benefit**: Immediate, visible, easy to calculate
- **Competitive Advantage**: "Kotak charges zero, others charge 1-3%"

#### Actual Cost to Kotak
- **Direct Cost**: Rs 0 (fee is just absorbed margin, not out-of-pocket expense)
- **Margin Sacrifice**: 1-3% of loan amount (but recovered via interest over time)
- **Opportunity Cost**: Minimal (fee is discretionary, not standard revenue)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Customer Value:         Rs 3,000-30,000 (perceived, tangible)
Kotak Cost:             Rs 0 (absorbed margin)
Value-to-Cost Ratio:    INFINITE
Effectiveness:          HIGH
Conversion Impact:      +20-30% (removes cost hesitation)
```

#### Why It Works
- Zero direct cost to Kotak (just foregone revenue)
- High perceived value (customers see it as "saving Rs 5K-15K")
- Easy to communicate ("Zero processing fee for switching")
- Competitive differentiation (most banks charge 0.5-2%)

---

### 3. Insured Transit Service (Absorbed by Kotak)
**HIGH Effectiveness**

#### Friction Addressed
- **Safety anxiety**: "What if Rs 5L worth of gold gets lost/stolen during transit?"
- **Personal liability**: "I'm 100% responsible if I carry it myself"
- **Theft risk**: Real concern in metros (snatching, bag theft)
- **Family coordination**: Need someone to accompany for safety

#### Customer Value Perception
- **Peace of Mind**: Priceless (anxiety elimination)
- **Insurance Value**: Rs 3-10L coverage (matches gold value)
- **Convenience**: Don't have to take time off work for transit
- **Professional Service**: GPS tracking, trained personnel

#### Actual Cost to Kotak
- **Insurance Premium**: Rs 50-100 per transit (covers Rs 3-10L gold value)
- **Logistics Fee**: Rs 50-100 per transit (partner courier service)
- **Total Cost**: Rs 100-200 per switch

#### ROI Analysis
```
Customer Value:         Rs 5,000-10,000 (perceived, anxiety relief)
Kotak Cost:             Rs 100-200
Value-to-Cost Ratio:    25x - 100x
Effectiveness:          HIGH
Conversion Impact:      +15-25% (reduces Day 8-9 drop-offs)
```

#### Why It Works
- Addresses major anxiety point (gold transit safety)
- Low cost, high perceived value
- Professional service elevates brand ("Kotak takes care of everything")
- Reduces drop-offs at Day 8-9 (post-redemption anxiety)

---

### 4. 24-Month Rate Lock
**MEDIUM-HIGH Effectiveness**

#### Friction Addressed
- **Future uncertainty**: "What if Kotak increases rates after I switch?"
- **Rate volatility**: Market rates fluctuate 1-3% annually
- **Switching fatigue**: "I don't want to switch again if rates rise"

#### Customer Value Perception
- **Predictability**: Budget certainty for 2 years
- **Protection**: Locked at 9.5-10.5% even if market goes to 12-14%
- **Peace of Mind**: No surprises, no need to monitor rates

#### Actual Cost to Kotak
- **Margin Risk**: If market rates rise 2-3%, Kotak absorbs higher cost of funds
- **Opportunity Cost**: Can't reprice upward for 24 months
- **Expected Cost**: Rs 1,000-3,000 per customer (depending on rate movements)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Customer Value:         Rs 5,000-15,000 (perceived protection)
Kotak Cost:             Rs 0-3,000 (only if rates rise significantly)
Value-to-Cost Ratio:    2x - INFINITE (if rates don't rise)
Effectiveness:          MEDIUM-HIGH
Retention Impact:       +30-40% (reduces churn at 12-24 month mark)
```

#### Why It Works
- Creates stickiness (customers less likely to shop around)
- Differentiates from NBFCs (who adjust rates frequently)
- Expected cost is low (rates stable 2022-2025, likely through 2026-2027)
- Strategic investment in customer retention

---

### 5. Instant Cashback (Rs 1,000-3,000 for Loans Rs 3L+)
**MEDIUM Effectiveness**

#### Friction Addressed
- **Effort compensation**: "At least I get something for my time"
- **Instant gratification**: Immediate benefit, not just future savings
- **Switching hesitation**: "Is it worth the hassle?" → "Yes, I get Rs 2K instantly"

#### Customer Value Perception
- **Tangible Benefit**: Rs 1,000-3,000 cash in hand
- **Immediate**: Credited within 7 days
- **Bonus**: On top of interest savings

#### Actual Cost to Kotak
- **Direct Cost**: Rs 1,000-3,000 per customer (P&L expense)
- **Strategic Cost**: Acceptable for Rs 3L-10L loans (0.03-1% of loan size)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Customer Value:         Rs 1,000-3,000 (tangible, immediate)
Kotak Cost:             Rs 1,000-3,000 (direct expense)
Value-to-Cost Ratio:    1x (neutral)
Effectiveness:          MEDIUM
Conversion Impact:      +10-15% (tips fence-sitters)
```

#### Why It Works
- Instant gratification (reinforces switching decision)
- Offsets minor inconveniences (2 branch visits, paperwork)
- Competitive (other banks offer similar, we need to match)
- Acceptable cost for loan sizes Rs 3L+ (0.03-1% only)

#### Risk
- Attracts some deal-seekers (who may churn post-cashback)
- Mitigated by: Minimum 24-month tenure requirement (claw-back if prepaid early)

---

## LOW ROI Incentives (AVOID)

### 1. Generic Cashback Without Conditions
**LOW Effectiveness**

#### The Trap
- **Offer**: Rs 5,000-10,000 cashback, no strings attached
- **Result**: Attracts deal-seekers who switch for cashback, then switch again
- **Problem**: High acquisition cost, low lifetime value, high churn

#### Why It Fails
- Cashback-driven customers are disloyal (rate shoppers)
- No friction solved (just money thrown at acquisition)
- Competitors can match/exceed (race to bottom)
- Dilutes brand (Kotak = discount bank, not premium)

#### Data
- **60-70% churn** within 12 months post-cashback
- **NPS: 4-6** (transactional relationship, not loyalty)
- **Referral rate: <10%** (deal-seekers don't refer, they're embarrassed)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Cashback Cost:          Rs 5,000-10,000
Customer LTV:           Rs 15,000-25,000 (low due to churn)
CAC:LTV Ratio:          1:1.5 to 1:5 (poor economics)
Effectiveness:          LOW
```

**VERDICT: AVOID. Use friction-solving incentives instead.**

---

### 2. Gift Cards (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)
**LOW Effectiveness**

#### The Problem
- **Disconnected from value prop**: What does Amazon gift card have to do with gold loan?
- **Cheapens brand**: Kotak looks like a rewards credit card, not a premium bank
- **No psychological impact**: Feels like generic promotion
- **Attracts wrong audience**: Deal-seekers, not serious borrowers

#### Why It Fails
- No connection to customer pain point
- Doesn't solve any friction
- Competitors do the same (no differentiation)
- Customers forget who gave the gift card (low brand recall)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Gift Card Cost:         Rs 2,000-5,000
Customer LTV Impact:    Minimal (no loyalty created)
Brand Dilution:         HIGH
Effectiveness:          LOW
```

**VERDICT: AVOID. Not aligned with premium banking positioning.**

---

### 3. Lucky Draws / Contest Entries
**VERY LOW Effectiveness**

#### The Problem
- **Dilutes serious positioning**: Gold loan is a financial need, not a lottery
- **Attracts wrong customers**: "I'll apply just to enter the draw"
- **Low perceived value**: 1 in 10,000 chance of winning ≈ Rs 0 expected value
- **High cost if prize is large**: Rs 1L prize / 10,000 entries = Rs 10 per person (but feels worthless to 9,999)

#### Why It Fails
- No serious customer makes financial decisions based on lucky draws
- Creates noise (applications from unqualified/uninterested customers)
- Operational burden (managing contest, announcing winners, legal compliance)
- Brand mismatch (Kotak = premium bank, not consumer promotion)

#### ROI Analysis
```
Prize Pool:             Rs 1-5L (for 5,000-10,000 entries)
Cost per Entry:         Rs 10-50
Serious Conversion:     <1% (99% applied for draw, not loan)
Effectiveness:          VERY LOW
```

**VERDICT: STRONGLY AVOID. Completely off-brand for gold loan switching.**

#### Test 3: Transit Service Positioning
- **Group A**: "Free insured transit" (zero customer cost)
- **Group B**: "Rs 200 insured transit" (customer pays)
- **Group C**: "Optional insured transit" (customer chooses)
- **Measure**: Conversion rate, transit adoption, NPS
- **Hypothesis**: "Free" positioning drives higher completion (Day 8-9 drop-off reduced)

#### Test 4: Processing Fee Waiver Communication
- **Group A**: "Save Rs 5,000 - Zero processing fee!" (savings framing)
- **Group B**: "Zero processing fee for balance transfers" (neutral framing)
- **Group C**: "Special offer: Processing fee waived" (offer framing)
- **Measure**: Click-through rate, conversion rate
- **Hypothesis**: Savings framing (A) drives highest engagement

### Expected Learnings (Post-Pilot)
- Optimal cashback amount by loan size
- Rate lock impact on retention vs margin cost
- Transit service adoption rate (free vs paid)
- Messaging effectiveness for fee waiver

## Strategic Recommendations

### DO: Invest in Friction-Solving Incentives
1. **Bridge Loan** (VERY HIGH ROI) - the killer feature
2. **Processing Fee Waiver** (INFINITE ROI) - zero cost, high value
3. **Insured Transit** (HIGH ROI) - low cost, huge anxiety relief
4. **24-Month Rate Lock** (MEDIUM ROI) - strategic retention investment

### DON'T: Waste Money on Generic Discounts
1. ❌ **Generic Cashback** - attracts deal-seekers, high churn
2. ❌ **Gift Cards** - off-brand, no differentiation
3. ❌ **Lucky Draws** - dilutes serious positioning

### CUSTOMIZE: By Segment & Loan Size
- **High-Value (Rs 10L+)**: Focus on relationship + VIP service
- **Trust-Seekers (Rs 5-10L)**: Focus on safety + transparency
- **Women (Rs 3-7L)**: Focus on insured transit + safety
- **Young (Rs 3-5L)**: Focus on digital + instant cashback

### MEASURE: Continuously Optimize
- A/B test cashback amounts (Rs 1K vs Rs 2K vs Rs 3K)
- Track NPS, churn, referrals by incentive type
- Monitor margin impact of rate lock (if rates rise)
- Refine segment targeting based on pilot data
