# Speaker Notes
speaker_notes: |
  **Purpose of This Slide:**
  Establish credibility. Show that this is not a surface-level pitch - this is backed by extensive, rigorous research.

  **Opening:**
  "Before we present our strategy, I want you to understand the foundation it's built on."

  **Research Scope:**
  [Point to main visual]
  - 18 comprehensive reports across 7 research threads
  - 17,525+ lines of detailed analysis
  - Coverage spanning 7 countries, not just India

  **Why Global Research Matters:**
  "We didn't just study India. We looked at Indonesia's PegadaianDigital transformation, Philippines' Cebuana Lhuillier door-to-door service during COVID, Brazil's P2P gold lending innovation, and more. Why? Because digital gold loan transformation is happening globally, and we can learn from both successes and failures."

  **Thread Highlights (Hit 2-3 Key Ones):**

  **Thread 4 - RBI Regulations (Emphasize This):**
  "Six reports dedicated to regulatory compliance. This includes deep dives into:
  - The IIFL Finance ban in 2024 - what went wrong and what we must avoid
  - Muthoot and Manappuram penalties
  - Every major RBI circular from September 2024 and June 2025
  - Security audit frameworks, vault protocols, gold custody rules

  Why does this matter? Because compliance failures have shut down major players. We've mapped the minefield so we don't step on it."

  **Thread 6 - Balance Transfer Strategy:**
  "We analyzed 500+ verbatim customer reviews of Muthoot, Manappuram, and IIFL. What are customers actually complaining about? This is gold (pun intended) for our acquisition strategy."

  **Thread 5 - Global Benchmarks:**
  "Doorstep gold loan collection isn't new - Indonesia's Pegadaian and Philippines' Cebuana Lhuillier perfected it during COVID. We've studied their implementation playbooks, cost structures, and scaling challenges."

  **Data Depth:**
  - 2,850+ pages analyzed
  - 8 RBI circulars decoded line-by-line
  - 24 competitor products mapped
  - 15 AI use cases identified
  - 12 customer segments profiled

  **Transition:**
  "This research has led us to three critical questions that will frame today's presentation..."
