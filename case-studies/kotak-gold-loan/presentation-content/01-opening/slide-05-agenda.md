# Speaker Notes
speaker_notes: |
  **Purpose:**
  Give the board a clear roadmap of the next 60 minutes. Show structure and priorities.

  **Delivery:**
  [Display full agenda timeline]

  "Here's our agenda for the next hour. We have 13 sections, moving from opportunity to execution."

  **Three-Act Structure:**
  [Gesture to sections]

  "I've structured this as a three-act story:

  **Act 1 - Setup (Sections 2-4):**
  - Market Opportunity: How big is this?
  - Competitor Crisis: Why is now the perfect moment?
  - Customer Psychology: What's the barrier we must overcome?

  By the end of Act 1, you'll understand the market size, the competitive window, and the trust challenge.

  **Act 2 - Solution (Sections 5-9):**
  This is the heart of our strategy:
  - Target Segments: Who exactly are we going after?
  - Switch & Save Product: Our core offering - bridge loans that make switching effortless
  - Personalized Pitch: How we convert with precision, not mass marketing
  - AI-Powered Acquisition: The technology engine behind identification and personalization
  - Doorstep Pilot: How we deliver NBFC convenience with bank trust

  **Three Priority Sections** [Point to highlighted sections]:
  - **Switch & Save Product (6 minutes):** The bridge loan is our killer feature. We pay off their NBFC loan, retrieve their gold, and re-pledge it to Kotak - all in 48 hours. Customer does nothing.
  - **Personalized Pitch (5 minutes):** Every customer gets a custom offer. 'Lakshmi, you're paying Rs 80,000/year. Switch and pay Rs 40,000.'
  - **Doorstep Pilot (6 minutes):** We come to the customer's home, test purity on the spot, and disburse instantly. This is how we compete with NBFCs on convenience while maintaining bank-level compliance.

  **Act 3 - Execution (Sections 10-13):**
  - Financials: Rs 1,600 crore book, Rs 176 crore income in Year 1
  - Risk & Compliance: Learning from IIFL and Muthoot failures
  - Roadmap: Q1 2026 pilot to Q1 2027 national rollout
  - Call to Action: What we need from the board today

  **Time Management:**
  Total: 60 minutes
  - Act 1: 14 minutes
  - Act 2: 26 minutes (this is where we spend the most time)
  - Act 3: 15 minutes
  - Buffer: 5 minutes for questions throughout

  **Flexibility:**
  'If there are specific sections you want to dive deeper into, we have detailed backup slides. But I'll keep us moving to respect your time.'

  **Transition:**
  'Let's start with the market opportunity. How big is this prize?'"
