# Strategic Framing
framing:
  context: "These three questions frame our entire presentation"
  promise: "By the end, you'll have clear, actionable answers to all three"
  approach: "Data-driven, customer-centric, compliance-first"

# Speaker Notes
speaker_notes: |
  **Purpose:**
  Set up the intellectual framework for the entire presentation. These aren't random questions - they're the three pillars of our strategy.

  **Delivery:**
  [Pause after displaying the slide. Let the questions sink in.]

  "These are the three questions that will guide our discussion today. Let me walk through each one."

  **Question 1: Why NOW?**
  [Point to Q1]
  "Why is this the perfect moment for Kotak to aggressively enter gold loans? Three words: Competitor. Crisis. Opportunity.

  - In November 2024, RBI banned IIFL Finance from issuing new gold loans. That's a Rs 30,000 crore book frozen.
  - Muthoot and Manappuram are bleeding from compliance costs and regulatory penalties
  - New RBI regulations on vault security, audit protocols, and LTV enforcement favor well-capitalized banks over NBFCs
  - Result: 4-6 million customers are either displaced or dissatisfied and actively looking for alternatives

  This is our window. And it won't stay open forever."

  **Question 2: How to Convert?**
  [Point to Q2]
  "How do we convert existing Kotak customers who currently have gold loans with NBFCs? This is the heart of our acquisition strategy.

  The answer has four parts:
  1. **Identify:** Use AI to scan our 53M customer base and identify 4-6M with NBFC gold loans
  2. **Personalize:** Send targeted offers - 'Lakshmi, you're paying Rs 80,000/year to Muthoot. Switch to Kotak and pay Rs 40,000.'
  3. **Simplify:** Offer bridge loans - we pay off Muthoot, retrieve gold, re-pledge to Kotak. Customer does nothing.
  4. **Trust:** Doorstep service, gold stays at local branch, video vault access, transparent processes

  This isn't mass marketing. This is precision surgery."

  **Question 3: What's Our Edge?**
  [Point to Q3]
  "Lower interest rates are table stakes. Federal Bank offers 11.5%, we'll offer 10-11%. So why would customers choose Kotak over Federal Bank, HDFC, or SBI?

  Our differentiation is a three-legged stool:
  1. **NBFC Convenience + Bank Trust:** Doorstep collection (like Muthoot) but with Kotak's brand and regulatory compliance
  2. **Technology:** Real-time video access to your gold in the vault via mobile app. AI-powered instant valuation.
  3. **Existing Relationship:** 'Lakshmi, you've trusted us for 8 years with your salary, your MFs, your insurance. We already know you. We already serve you. Why go to a stranger?'

  This is about being BETTER, not just CHEAPER."

  **Closing:**
  "These three questions - Why now? How to convert? What's our edge? - will be answered systematically in the next 30 minutes. Let's start with the agenda."

  **Transition:**
  "Here's how we'll cover this ground..."
