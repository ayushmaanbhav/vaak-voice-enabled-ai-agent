# Speaker Notes
speaker_notes: |
  **Storytelling Approach:**
  "Let me introduce you to Lakshmi. She's not a hypothetical customer - she represents a composite of actual Kotak banking customers we've identified through data analysis."

  **The Setup:**
  - Lakshmi is 42, runs a textile MSME in Pune
  - She's been a Kotak customer for 8 years - salary account, business current account, mutual fund SIPs
  - She trusts us with lakhs of rupees in deposits and investments

  **The Paradox:**
  - But when she needed Rs 4 lakh for working capital 3 years ago, she went to Muthoot Finance
  - She's paying 22% interest - that's Rs 80,000 per year
  - If she came to Kotak at 10%, she'd pay Rs 40,000 - saving Rs 40,000 annually

  **The Concerns (This is Critical):**
  [Read through her concerns - pause for effect]

  Notice: These aren't about interest rates. They're about TRUST and ACCESS.
  - She doesn't know if we'll keep gold locally or ship to central vault
  - She worries about retrieval speed
  - She sees NBFCs as "gold specialists" and banks as "generalists"
  - Her gold jewelry is her grandmother's - it's not just collateral

  **The Insight:**
  This is the core challenge we must solve. It's not pricing - we already beat NBFCs on rates. It's TRUST + ACCESS + SPECIALIZATION perception.

  **The Scale:**
  [Point to closing question]
  "53 million Kotak customers. Based on industry benchmarks, 8-12% likely have active gold loans with NBFCs. That's 4-6 million customers. If even 10% of them are like Lakshmi - overpaying by Rs 40,000/year - we're looking at a Rs 1,600-2,400 crore annual interest income opportunity."

  **Transition:**
  "To solve Lakshmi's problem at scale, we needed to understand this market deeply. Let me show you the research foundation we've built..."

*"What if I can't get my gold back?"*

**Her Concerns:**
- **Safety:** Will my jewelry be kept safely?
- **Access:** Can I get it back quickly if needed?

### How many are paying too much?

**Estimated:** 4-6 million have active gold loans with NBFCs
**Average overpayment:** Rs 40,000/year

The question is: How do we win Lakshmi's TRUST?*
