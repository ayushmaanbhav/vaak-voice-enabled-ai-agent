# Doorstep Gold Loans: The Convenience Frontier

## Why Doorstep Matters

### Customer Pain Points
- **30% of gold loan customers** cite "branch visits" as major pain point
- **Working professionals** can't visit during branch hours (9am-5pm)
- **Women customers** often prefer home-based transactions for safety/convenience
- **Rural customers**: nearest branch may be 30+ km away

### Regulatory Status: ALLOWED with Restrictions

**Key Requirements:**
- Gold must reach bank vault **same day** (cannot store in BC custody)
- Appraisal cannot be fully delegated to BC
- Secure, insured, time-bound transfer required
- Full audit trail mandatory

**Precedent:**
