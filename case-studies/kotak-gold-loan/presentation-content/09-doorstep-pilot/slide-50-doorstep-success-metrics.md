# Doorstep Pilot: Success Criteria

## Primary Metrics (Go/No-Go Decision Makers)

### 1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **CAC per Customer** | <Rs 10,000 | Rs 8,000-12,000 | >Rs 15,000 |

**Calculation:**
```
CAC = (Marketing Spend + Sales Expense + Doorstep Service Cost) / # of New Customers Acquired
```

**Why this matters:**
- Competitor CAC for gold loan: Rs 8,000-12,000
- Lifetime value of gold loan customer: Rs 25,000-30,000 (assuming 3-year relationship)
- CAC should be <33% of LTV for healthy unit economics

**Monthly Tracking:**
| Month | Marketing Spend | Doorstep Cost | New Customers | CAC |
|-------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| M1 | Rs 5L | Rs 2L | 20 | Rs 35,000 ⚠️ |
| M2 | Rs 4L | Rs 5L | 50 | Rs 18,000 🟡 |
| M3-4 | Rs 6L | Rs 10L | 100 | Rs 16,000 🟡 |
| M5-6 | Rs 8L | Rs 15L | 150 | Rs 15,333 🟡 |
| **Target by M6** | - | - | **500** | **<Rs 10,000** ✅ |

### 2. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **NPS (out of 5)** | >4.0 | 3.8-4.2 | <3.5 |

**Measurement:**
- Survey sent within 24 hours of disbursement
- Question: "How likely are you to recommend Kotak doorstep gold loan to friends/family?" (1-5 scale)
- Mandatory response for service improvement

**Components Tracked:**
- **Convenience:** Time saved vs. branch visit
- **Trust:** Executive professionalism, gold handling
- **Speed:** Request to disbursement time
- **Transparency:** Appraisal process, pricing clarity
- **Overall Experience:** Would use again?

**Minimum Sample:** 300 responses (60% response rate assumed)

### 3. Average Ticket Size

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Avg. Ticket Size** | >Rs 1,00,000 | Rs 80K-1.2L | <Rs 50,000 |

**Why this matters:**
- Doorstep economics only viable at Rs 1L+ (cost <1%)
- If avg. ticket size is Rs 50K, service is subsidized
- Low ticket size indicates wrong customer segment targeted

**Tracking by City:**
| City | Target Avg. Ticket | Actual (Pilot End) | Status |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Mumbai | Rs 1.5L | TBD | - |
| Chennai | Rs 1.2L | TBD | - |
| Hyderabad | Rs 1.1L | TBD | - |
| Pune | Rs 1.3L | TBD | - |
| Bangalore | Rs 1.2L | TBD | - |

### 4. Same-Day Disbursement Rate

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Same-Day %** | >90% | 85-95% | <70% |

**Definition:** Loan amount credited to customer account within 24 hours of doorstep visit

**Failure Reasons to Track:**
- Technical issues (app/system downtime)
- Gold appraisal discrepancy requiring re-verification
- Customer documentation incomplete
- Transit delay (traffic/logistics)

**Mitigation:** Any <90% month triggers root cause analysis

### 5. Gold Transit Incidents

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Incidents** | 0 | 0 | ANY incident |

**Zero-tolerance policy:**
- Any gold loss/theft/damage → Immediate pilot review
- Executive suspended pending investigation
- Insurance claim processed within 48 hours
- Customer compensated at claimed value (no dispute)

## Secondary Metrics (Optimization Signals)

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Conversion Rate** | 25% | Lead quality and sales effectiveness |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | 4.5/5 | Service quality benchmark |
| **Time: Request → Disbursement** | <4 hours | Speed/efficiency measure |
| **Repeat Usage Intent** | 80% | Customer loyalty indicator |
| **Executive Productivity** | 10 loans/month | Resource utilization |
| **App Usage Rate** | 70% | Digital adoption |

### Conversion Funnel Tracking

| Stage | Target Conversion | Actual | Leakage Point? |
