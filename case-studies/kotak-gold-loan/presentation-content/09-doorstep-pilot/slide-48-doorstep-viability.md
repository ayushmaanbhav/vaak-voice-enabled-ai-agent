## Break-Even Economics

### Revenue vs. Cost Analysis
**Assumptions:**
- Interest rate: 10% per annum
- Loan tenure: 12 months
- Processing fee: 1% of loan amount

| Loan Amount | Annual Interest | Processing Fee | Total Revenue | Cost | Net Margin |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|------|------------|
| Rs 25,000 | Rs 2,500 | Rs 250 | Rs 2,750 | Rs 850 | Rs 1,900 (69%) |
| Rs 50,000 | Rs 5,000 | Rs 500 | Rs 5,500 | Rs 850 | Rs 4,650 (85%) |
| Rs 1,00,000 | Rs 10,000 | Rs 1,000 | Rs 11,000 | Rs 850 | Rs 10,150 (92%) |
| Rs 2,00,000 | Rs 20,000 | Rs 2,000 | Rs 22,000 | Rs 850 | Rs 21,150 (96%) |

### The Viability Question
> **Why not offer doorstep for Rs 25K if margin is still 69%?**

**Answer:** Customer perception and competitive positioning
- High service cost signals premium positioning
- Need to maintain economics at scale
- Avoid cannibalizing profitable branch channel
- Reserve doorstep as differentiator for higher-value segments

## Sweet Spot Analysis

### Optimal Loan Size: Rs 1L - Rs 3L
**Reasons:**
1. **Cost efficiency:** <1% of loan amount
2. **Customer willingness to pay:** Convenience premium accepted
3. **Risk management:** Lower ticket size limits transit risk
4. **Market alignment:** Average gold loan in Tier 1 cities is Rs 1.2L

### Volume Projection by Segment
Based on Kotak's current customer base:

| Segment | % of Customers | Doorstep Adoption | Monthly Volume |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| <Rs 50K | 40% | 0% | 0 |
| Rs 50K-1L | 35% | 20% | 25 loans |
| Rs 1L-2L | 20% | 50% | 35 loans |
| Rs 2L+ | 5% | 80% | 15 loans |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | - | **75 loans/month** |

**Pilot Target:** 500 loans in 6 months = 84/month
**Conclusion:** Target is achievable with focused marketing

## Channel Incentive Structure

### Steering Customers to Right Channel

| Channel | Minimum Ticket | Incentive/Disincentive |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Digital (App)** | No minimum | 0.25% rate discount |
