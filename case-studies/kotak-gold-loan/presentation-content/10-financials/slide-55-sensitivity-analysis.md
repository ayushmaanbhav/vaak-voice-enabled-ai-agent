# What If We're Wrong? Still Good.

## Key Assumptions and Sensitivity

| Parameter | Base Case | Range | Impact on 3-Year PAT | Likelihood |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------------------|------------|
| **Yield** | 10% | 9-11% | +/- Rs 25 Cr | Medium (competitive pressure) |
| **Cost of Funds** | 5% | 4.5-5.5% | +/- Rs 15 Cr | Low (bank advantage stable) |
| **Customer Acquisition** | 50K Y1 | 40K-60K | +/- Rs 10 Cr | Medium (execution dependent) |
| **Operating Cost** | 1.5% | 1.2-1.8% | +/- Rs 8 Cr | Medium (scale dependent) |
| **Credit Cost (NPA)** | 0.35% | 0.2-0.5% | +/- Rs 5 Cr | Low (gold secured) |

## Parameter Sensitivity Ranking (Impact on PAT)

1. **Yield (Interest Rate)**: Highest impact (+/- Rs 25 Cr per 1% change)
   - Range: 9-11% (NBFC competition to premium positioning)
   - Mitigation: Brand premium, service differentiation, AI-driven pricing

2. **Cost of Funds**: Second highest (+/- Rs 15 Cr per 0.5% change)
   - Range: 4.5-5.5% (bank funding advantage)
   - Mitigation: Kotak's low-cost CASA base (53%+)

3. **Customer Acquisition**: Third (+/- Rs 10 Cr per 10K customers)
   - Range: 40K-60K Year 1
   - Mitigation: Existing customer base (13M+), phased rollout

4. **Operating Cost**: Fourth (+/- Rs 8 Cr per 0.3% of AUM)
   - Range: 1.2-1.8% of AUM
   - Mitigation: Shared infrastructure, AI automation

5. **Credit Cost**: Lowest (+/- Rs 5 Cr per 0.15% change)
   - Range: 0.2-0.5% (well below unsecured lending)
   - Mitigation: Gold collateral, conservative LTV (75%)

## Downside Protection: Why This is Low Risk

| Protection Factor | Mechanism | Industry Evidence |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Collateral Security** | Gold pledged = zero unsecured risk | NBFC NPA: 0.0-0.3% vs 1-2% unsecured |
| **Gold Price Appreciation** | Natural LTV cushion over time | Gold +45% in 3 years; +200% in 10 years |
| **RBI Regulations** | 75% LTV cap = 25% buffer | Industry-wide discipline |
| **Phased Investment** | Can pause/adjust if metrics miss | Not all-in Day 1 |
| **Existing Infrastructure** | Kotak branches, systems, brand | Lower setup cost than greenfield |

## Stress Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | 3-Year PAT | ROI | Payback | Assessment |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----|---------|------------|
| **Base Case** | All assumptions hold | Rs 363 Cr | 2.45x | 20 months | Target |
| **Mild Stress** | -10% AUM, +0.2% NPA | Rs 310 Cr | 2.09x | 23 months | Still strong |
| **Severe Stress** | -30% AUM, +0.5% NPA, -0.5% yield | Rs 220 Cr | 1.49x | 28 months | Still profitable |
| **Catastrophic** | -50% AUM, +1% NPA, -1% yield | Rs 95 Cr | 0.64x | 40+ months | Requires pivot |

## What Each Scenario Means

**Base Case (Target):**
- 425K customers, Rs 8,500 Cr AUM, 2.45x ROI
- Probability: 60% (assumes execution per plan)

**Mild Stress (Achievable):**
- 382K customers, Rs 7,650 Cr AUM, 2.09x ROI
- Probability: 30% (slower ramp but still solid)
- Still beats most Kotak investments

**Severe Stress (Challenged but Viable):**
- 297K customers, Rs 5,950 Cr AUM, 1.49x ROI
- Probability: 9% (major execution issues or market shift)
- ROI still positive, payback within 3 years

**Catastrophic (Unlikely):**
- 212K customers, Rs 4,250 Cr AUM, 0.64x ROI
- Probability: <1% (requires multiple simultaneous failures)
- Even here: positive PAT, just below investment

## Key Insight: Downside is Protected

**Even if we're significantly wrong:**
- Mild stress scenario still delivers 2.09x ROI
- Severe stress scenario still delivers 1.49x ROI
- Only catastrophic scenario (sub-1% probability) fails to break even in 3 years

**Why gold loans protect downside:**
- Collateral = hard asset with intrinsic value
- Gold price tends to appreciate (hedge against stress)
- LTV limits = structural protection
- Can auction gold if needed (liquid secondary market)
