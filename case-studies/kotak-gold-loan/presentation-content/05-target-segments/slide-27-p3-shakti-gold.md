# P3: Shakti Gold - Women Entrepreneurs

## Market Opportunity

### The Untapped Potential

**Market Size**: 36-38% of all gold loan borrowers are women (and growing)

**Growth Trajectory**:
- **4 crore NEW women borrowers** added between 2019-2024
- Fastest-growing segment in gold loan industry
- COVID accelerated women's economic participation
- Rise of women-led MSMEs, SHGs, and home businesses

**Geographic Concentration**:
| State | Women Borrowers | Market Insight |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Tamil Nadu** | 44% of total borrowers | Highest women participation in India |
| **Andhra Pradesh** | 41% of total borrowers | Strong SHG network, entrepreneurship culture |
| **Karnataka** | 34% of total borrowers | Bangalore + tier 2 cities driving growth |
| **Kerala** | 38% of total borrowers | High gold ownership, financial literacy |
| **Maharashtra** | 28% of total borrowers | Urban women professionals + rural MSMEs |

**Why Women Are Underserved**:
- Traditional gold loan marketing targets men
- NBFCs don't offer women-specific products
- Branch environments not always welcoming
- Lack of female relationship managers
- No products addressing women's business cycles

## Customer Profile

### Demographics
- **Age**: 25-50 years
- **Occupation**:
  - Women entrepreneurs (boutiques, catering, beauty, education)
  - SHG members running micro-businesses
  - Agricultural producers (dairy, poultry, organic farming)
  - Professionals running side businesses
- **Income**: Rs 2-10 lakh annually (business revenue)
- **Gold Holdings**: 80-200 grams (personal jewelry + family gold)
- **Location**: Tier 1 cities (40%) + Tier 2/3 cities (60%)

### Business Characteristics
- **Business Type**: Service-based, low capital intensity
- **Working Capital Needs**: Rs 1-5 lakh (inventory, equipment, expansion)
- **Loan Purpose**:
  - Stock purchase for festivals/seasons
  - Equipment (sewing machines, ovens, laptops)
  - Shop/workspace rent advance
  - Emergency family needs (education, medical)

## The Credit Quality Advantage

### Women Are Better Borrowers (Data-Backed)

**Default Rates**:
- **Women**: 5.2% average default rate

**Why Women Perform Better**:
1. **Higher repayment discipline**: Social pressure, family responsibility
2. **Conservative borrowing**: Take only what they can repay
3. **Business sustainability**: Focus on steady income, not aggressive growth
4. **Emotional attachment**: Gold is often sentimental (mother's jewelry)

**4. Network Effects**
- Women refer other women (trust networks)
- SHG model creates viral growth
- Community building → low-cost customer retention

**5. Long-Term Pipeline**
- Today's Rs 2 lakh borrower = Tomorrow's Rs 10 lakh borrower
- As businesses grow, loan sizes increase
- Cross-sell: business accounts, insurance, investments
