# The Math That Changes Minds

## The Savings That Speak Louder Than Words

### Annual Interest Comparison

| Loan Amount | NBFC Rate (18%) | Kotak Rate (10%) | Annual Savings | % Savings |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| ₹2 lakh     | ₹36,000         | ₹20,000          | **₹16,000**    | **44%**   |
| ₹5 lakh     | ₹90,000         | ₹50,000          | **₹40,000**    | **44%**   |
| ₹10 lakh    | ₹1,80,000       | ₹1,00,000        | **₹80,000**    | **44%**   |

## The Psychological Tipping Point

### Why ₹3 Lakh is the Magic Number

**₹24,000 annual savings** crosses the mental threshold where:
- Savings > Perceived switching hassle
- ROI on effort becomes obvious
- Financial logic overrides emotional inertia

### Customer Internal Dialogue

> "₹24,000 saved is worth one weekend of my time"
> "That's two months of groceries for free"
> "I'm literally paying ₹2,000 extra every month for nothing"

## Design Notes

**Visual Treatment:**
- Large, bold savings numbers in Kotak Red (#ED1C24)
- Calculator/digital display aesthetic
- Before/after slider animation showing interest paid
- Progress bar showing % savings (44% fill in Gold #C9A227)

**Psychological Anchoring:**
- Start with smallest loan amount (₹2L) to show "even small loans save big"
- Build to ₹10L to show exponential impact
- Highlight the ₹16,000-₹80,000 savings range in accent color

**Data Sources:**
- NBFC rate: Industry average from Muthoot/Manappuram (16-20%, using 18% as baseline)
- Kotak rate: Competitive positioning at 10-12% (using 10% as target rate)
- Calculation: Simple interest for clarity (though gold loans often use reducing balance)

## Speaker Notes

"The math is undeniable. At 18% versus 10%, a customer with a ₹5 lakh gold loan is paying ₹40,000 extra every year. That's not a rounding error—that's a family vacation, a child's school fees, or three months of household expenses.

Our research shows that once the annual savings cross ₹24,000—which happens around the ₹3 lakh loan mark—customers mentally shift from 'too much hassle' to 'I'd be stupid not to switch.'

The question isn't WHETHER they'll switch. It's WHEN they realize the math."
