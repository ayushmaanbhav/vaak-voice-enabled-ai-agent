## Psychological Framing: Savings as Life Value

### From Abstract to Concrete

| Time Period | Savings Amount | Tangible Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **1 Month** | ₹3,333 | Weekend family outing + dinner |
| **6 Months** | ₹20,000 | Gold jewelry for spouse |
| **1 Year** | ₹40,000 | Child's coaching classes for full year |
| **3 Years** | ₹1,20,000 | Small family wedding contribution |

---

## Customer Persona Examples

### Scenario 1: Business Owner (₹8L Loan)
**Current:** 18% with Muthoot
**Savings:** ₹64,000/year

> "₹64,000 saved = Inventory for festive season without additional borrowing"

---

### Scenario 2: Salaried Professional (₹3L Loan)
**Current:** 17% with Manappuram
**Savings:** ₹21,000/year

> "₹21,000 saved = Annual car insurance + maintenance"

---

### Scenario 3: Agricultural Income (₹6L Loan)
**Current:** 19% with IIFL
**Savings:** ₹54,000/year

> "₹54,000 saved = New tractor attachment or 3 acres of fertilizer"

## Speaker Notes

"We don't just show customers the percentage difference—we translate savings into LIFE VALUE.

When you tell someone they'll save 8% on interest, they think 'that's nice.' When you tell them they'll save ₹40,000, they think 'that's real money.' But when you show them that ₹40,000 means a family vacation to Goa or their child's school fees covered—that's when the decision becomes emotional.

This calculator isn't about math. It's about making the invisible visible. It's about helping customers see what they're LOSING by staying with their current lender.

The 3-year total is critical because gold loans are sticky—customers renew for years. Show them ₹1.2 lakh over 3 years, and suddenly switching becomes a no-brainer."

## Implementation Strategy

**Deployment Channels:**
1. **Branch**: Tablet-based calculator at every gold loan counter
2. **Website**: Landing page hero element with instant calculation
3. **Mobile App**: Dedicated savings calculator in home screen
4. **SMS/WhatsApp**: Link to calculator with pre-filled competitor rates
5. **Relationship Manager**: iPad tool for face-to-face customer meetings

**Data Capture:**
- Collect loan amount + competitor rate (no PII required)
- Track which savings tier converts best (₹20K vs ₹50K vs ₹1L+)
- A/B test lifestyle framing (vacation vs education vs financial)

**Psychological Optimization:**
- Default competitor rate to 18% (industry average)
- Show 3-year savings by default (larger number = bigger impact)
- Use loss aversion: "You're currently overpaying by ₹X"
