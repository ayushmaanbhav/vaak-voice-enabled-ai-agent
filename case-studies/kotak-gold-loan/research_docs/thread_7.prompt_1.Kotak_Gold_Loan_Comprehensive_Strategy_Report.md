# SECTION 2: CUSTOMER PSYCHOLOGY & SWITCHING ANALYSIS

## 2.1 The Central Question: Why Would Customers Switch?

### The Switching Economics

| Loan Amount | Current NBFC Cost (18% p.a.) | Kotak Cost (10% p.a.) | Annual Savings | % Savings |
|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Rs 2 lakh | Rs 36,000 | Rs 20,000 | **Rs 16,000** | 44% |
| Rs 5 lakh | Rs 90,000 | Rs 50,000 | **Rs 40,000** | 44% |
| Rs 10 lakh | Rs 1,80,000 | Rs 1,00,000 | **Rs 80,000** | 44% |

**Critical Finding**: For loans Rs 3 lakh and above, annual savings of Rs 24,000+ justify switching friction.

### The Trust Factor (Subtle Psychology)

Beyond interest savings, customers are responding to industry events:

| Trust Trigger | Customer Psychology | Kotak Response |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| "I saw news about gold loan problems" | Fear of inaccessibility | "Access your gold when YOU need it" |
| "My neighbor's gold was auctioned unfairly" | Auction anxiety | "Transparent auctions with 30-day notice" |
| "The branch always has long queues" | Service frustration | "Premium service, dedicated counters" |
| "I don't understand the charges" | Confusion, mistrust | "What you see is what you pay" |

### The Status Quo Bias Challenge

Customers resist switching due to:

| Barrier | Impact (1-10) | Kotak Mitigation |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Emotional attachment to current lender** | 7 | Trust messaging: "Your gold deserves bank protection" |
| **Fear of transit during switch** | 9 | **Kotak Switch Assist**: Insured transit service |
| **Cash flow gap during redemption** | 8 | **7-day bridge loan** at zero interest |
| **Multiple branch visits** | 6 | **Pre-approved offers** for existing Kotak customers |
| **Uncertainty about new process** | 5 | **Video tutorials**, branch appointment system |

## 2.2 Friction Analysis

### The Switching Process: Current State

```
Current Switching Journey (Without Intervention):
Day 1: Customer decides to switch
Day 2-3: Visits current lender for closure amount
Day 4-7: Arranges funds to close loan
Day 8: Redeems gold from current lender
Day 9: Transits gold (personal risk)
Day 10: Visits new lender for loan
Day 11+: Processing, waiting for disbursement

Total Time: 10-14 days
Customer Anxiety: HIGH
Success Rate: 40-50%
```

### The Switching Process: Kotak Switch Assist

```
Kotak Switch Assist Journey:
Day 0: Customer shows interest (app/branch)
Day 0: Pre-approval issued (existing Kotak customer)
Day 1: Bridge loan sanctioned (7-day zero interest)
Day 1: Funds transferred to close existing loan
Day 2-3: Customer redeems gold with Kotak-insured transit
Day 3: Gold pledged at Kotak branch
Day 3: Full gold loan replaces bridge loan

Total Time: 3 days
Customer Anxiety: LOW
Success Rate: 75-85%
```

## 2.3 Psychological Messaging Framework

### Core Message: "Bank-Grade Security. India's Smartest Gold Loan."

### Implicit Differentiation (Subtle Psychology)

| Message | Surface Meaning | Implied Contrast |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| "Your gold deserves vault-level protection" | We have great vaults | Others may not |
| "Zero regulatory concerns. Ever." | We're compliant | Others have had issues |
| "Access your gold when YOU need it" | Convenient access | Others may restrict |
| "Transparent valuation - watch it happen" | Open process | Others may hide |
| "Already meeting 2026 standards today" | We're ahead | Others are scrambling |
| "Bank-backed, not just promises" | Regulatory protection | NBFCs aren't banks |

### Segment-Specific Messaging

| Segment | Primary Fear | Message | Tone |
|---------|--------------|---------|------|
| **MSME Owner** | Business disruption | "Working capital that never stops" | Professional |
| **Trust-Seeker** | Gold safety | "Your gold. Our responsibility. Guaranteed." | Reassuring |
| **Women Borrower** | Respect, safety | "Shakti Gold: Financial independence, dignified service" | Empowering |
| **Young Professional** | Speed, convenience | "Gold loan in clicks, not queues" | Modern |

### AI-Powered Customer Identification

```
Gold Loan Propensity Score = f(
    Transaction_Signals,      // Payments to gold loan providers
    Demographic_Fit,          // Age, geography, occupation
    Financial_Stress,         // Account balance patterns
    Product_Holdings,         // Existing Kotak relationship depth
    Life_Events,              // Wedding, medical, education payments
    Seasonal_Triggers,        // Festivals, harvest cycles
    Switching_History         // Prior provider switches (HIGH WEIGHT)
)

### Switching History Parameter (High Predictive Value)

# SECTION 5: ACQUISITION STRATEGY & MESSAGING

## 5.1 The "Switch & Save" Product

### Product Design

| Feature | Specification | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Target** | Existing Kotak customers with competitor gold loans | Lower CAC, known credit behavior |
| **Minimum Amount** | Rs 3 lakh | Below this, savings don't justify friction |
| **Interest Rate** | 9.5-10.5% p.a. | 40-50% below typical NBFC rates |
| **Processing Fee** | Zero (for balance transfers) | Remove upfront friction |
| **Bridge Loan** | 7-day interest-free | Customer never lacks liquidity |
| **Rate Lock** | 24 months guaranteed | Creates stickiness |
| **Cashback** | Rs 1,000-3,000 (loans > Rs 5L) | Overcome switching inertia |

### Switch Assist Service

| Component | Description | Cost to Kotak |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Pre-Approval** | Instant offer based on Kotak relationship | Nil (system cost) |
| **Bridge Financing** | 7-day zero-interest loan to close existing loan | Interest float |
| **Transit Insurance** | Coverage during gold movement | Rs 100-200 per switch |
| **Dedicated Support** | Single point of contact for switching process | Staff time |

## 5.2 Messaging Architecture

## 8.2 Investment Prioritization

### Critical (Must-Have): Rs 37 Cr

| Investment | Cost | Rationale |
|------------|------|-----------|
| CV Appraisal + Predictive Model | Rs 7.5 Cr | Core acquisition engine |
| LTV Monitoring + Fraud | Rs 3.5 Cr | Compliance + loss prevention |
| Marketing & Campaigns | Rs 15 Cr | Customer acquisition |
| Compliance Infrastructure | Rs 10 Cr | Regulatory requirement |
| Training (mandatory) | Rs 1 Cr | Staff certification |

### Experimental (Prove-First): Rs 6.5 Cr

| Investment | Cost | Success Criteria Before Scaling |
|------------|------|--------------------------------|
| Personalization Engine (Ph1) | Rs 1.5 Cr | 5% conversion lift in 6 months |
| Doorstep Service Pilot | Rs 5 Cr | 500+ loans at <Rs 10K CAC |

### Doorstep Service: Regulatory & Cost Analysis

**Regulatory Status:** Allowed with restrictions (Federal Bank already operates via Rupeek partnership)

| Requirement | RBI Position |
|-------------|--------------|
| Gold custody | **Cannot be stored in BC custody** - must reach bank vault same day |
| Appraisal | Should not be delegated entirely to BC |
| Transport | Secure, insured, time-bound transfer to branch |
| Model | Partner model (Rupeek) or owned field executives |

**Cost Economics (Per Transaction):**

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Field Executive | Rs 400 |
| Vehicle + Fuel | Rs 200 |
| XRF Device (amortized) | Rs 100 |
| Transit Insurance | Rs 50 |
| Technology | Rs 100 |
| **Total per transaction** | **Rs 850** |

**Viability by Ticket Size:**

| Ticket Size | Cost % | Verdict |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Rs 25,000 | 3.4% | **Not viable** (branch/digital only) |
| Rs 50,000 | 1.7% | Marginal (promotional campaigns) |
| Rs 1,00,000 | 0.85% | **Viable** |
| Rs 2,00,000+ | 0.4% | **Highly viable** |

**Recommendation:** Doorstep service for **Rs 50,000+ ticket sizes** in 5 Tier 1 pilot cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Bangalore). Below threshold, incentivize branch/digital.

### Efficiency (Recommended): Rs 6 Cr

| Investment | Cost | Proceed If |
|------------|------|------------|
| Chatbot | Rs 2 Cr | Call center costs >Rs 50 lakh/quarter |
| Training Programs | Rs 4 Cr | Always proceed (remaining after mandatory portion) |

## 8.3 Cost of NOT Investing (Crisis Prevention)

### Quantified Risk of Compliance Failure

| Impact Category | Estimated Cost |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Portfolio Erosion (50% in crisis) | Rs 750 Cr at Rs 1,500 Cr AUM |
| Emergency Capital Requirement | Rs 300+ Cr |
| Remediation Costs | Rs 100+ Cr |
| Customer Re-acquisition | Rs 50+ Cr |
| Reputational Damage | Incalculable |
| **Total Crisis Cost** | **Rs 1,200+ Cr** |

### ROI of Compliance Investment

- Compliance Investment: Rs 10 Cr (Year 1)
- Crisis Prevention Value: Rs 1,200+ Cr
- **ROI: 120x in risk prevention**
