## 1. REGULATORY EVOLUTION (2022-2025)

The Reserve Bank of India issued its most comprehensive circular (RBI/2024-25/77) addressing widespread irregularities discovered during compliance reviews:

5. Weak LTV ratio monitoring and regulatory breaches
6. Excessive cash disbursements violating Income Tax Act limits
7. Multiple loans to same PAN within a financial year
8. Loan rollovers with only partial payments
9. Non-classification of overdue loans as NPAs (evergreening)
10. Low auction realization compared to estimated gold value
11. Lack of transparency in auction processes

**Compliance Requirements:**

**Key Provisions:**
- Tiered LTV ratios based on loan size
- Maximum 1 kg gold pledge limit (max 50g as coins)

#### June 2025: Final Directions on Gold and Silver Collateral
The RBI issued "Reserve Bank of India (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) Directions, 2025" to be implemented by April 1, 2026.

### 1.2 Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Evolution

**COVID-Era Changes (2020-2021):**
- Temporarily increased to 90% for relief during pandemic
- Provided liquidity to stressed households and MSMEs

**Post-COVID Normalization (2022-2023):**
- Reverted to standard 75% cap for all loans
- Stricter monitoring throughout loan tenure (not just at disbursement)

**2025 Tiered LTV Framework:**
- Loans ≤ Rs 2.5 lakh: 85% LTV (raised from 75%)
- Loans Rs 2.5-5 lakh: 80% LTV
- Loans > Rs 5 lakh: 75% LTV
- Agricultural/income-generating loans: Up to 85-90% (no strict cap)

**Critical Change:** LTV must be maintained throughout loan tenure, not just at origination.

### 1.3 Digital Lending Guidelines Applicability

#### September 2022: Original Digital Lending Guidelines
Established framework for digital lending with focus on:
- Customer protection
- Data privacy
- Fair lending practices
- Elimination of pass-through accounts

Expanded scope to include partial digital processes, not just fully digital loans.

- Enhanced risk management requirements

#### May 8, 2025: Consolidated Digital Lending Directions
Superseded and consolidated all previous frameworks into single comprehensive directive.

**Applicability to Gold Loans:**
While traditional gold loans are primarily branch-based, the guidelines significantly impact:

- Maximum 12-month tenure for bullet repayment
- No PSL classification

**Critical Restriction:** Same gold collateral cannot be used concurrently for both income and consumption purposes.

**Regulatory Concern (2024):** RBI found that lenders were not verifying end-use for non-agricultural loans and lacked proper documentation for agricultural loans.

- Facilitated evergreening of NPAs

**New Requirements (2024-2025):**
- Full repayment (principal + interest) required within original tenure
- Formal written request mandatory for renewals
- Renewals permitted only for "standard" loans (not NPAs)
- Fresh credit appraisal required for all renewals/top-ups
- For bullet loans: Past due interest must be cleared before top-up
- Third rollover treated as restructuring

**Special Provision for Small NBFCs:**
NBFCs with assets < Rs 500 crore can rollover short-term loans if:

## 8. CONCLUSION

The Indian gold loan industry from 2022-2025 underwent transformative regulatory tightening, technological advancement, and market consolidation. The RBI's aggressive stance on compliance, customer protection, and fair lending practices reshaped operational norms. Digital platforms and AI-driven innovations democratized access while enhancing efficiency. Market dynamics shifted toward organized players, with banks gaining share from strategic secured lending focus.

For Kotak Mahindra Bank, the opportunity lies in leveraging existing customer relationships, digital infrastructure, and competitive positioning to capture market share from both unorganized players and higher-rate NBFCs. Success requires:
1. Rate competitiveness aligned with public sector banks
2. Digital-first customer experience
3. Rigorous regulatory compliance
4. AI-driven risk management and customer targeting
5. Strategic partnerships for geographic expansion

The projected market growth to Rs 14.19 lakh crore by 2028 presents significant opportunity, with only 7% current penetration indicating substantial headroom. Kotak's challenge is to balance aggressive growth with compliance excellence in an increasingly regulated environment.
