## 1. CORE RBI GUIDELINES

### 1.1 LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) RATIO NORMS

**Current Regulations (Effective April 1, 2026):**

The RBI announced the latest gold loan guidelines on April 9, 2025, introducing a **tiered LTV structure** that represents a significant departure from the previous uniform 75% cap:

**Tiered LTV Limits:**
- **Up to ₹2.5 lakh:** Maximum 85% LTV
- **₹2.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh:** Maximum 80% LTV
- **Above ₹5 lakh:** Maximum 75% LTV

**Critical Requirements:**
- LTV must be maintained **throughout the loan tenure** (not just at sanction)
- LTV calculation must include **accrued interest**
- Monitored on an **ongoing basis**
- Breaches must be addressed immediately or face penalties

**Valuation Standards:**
- Collateral value = **lower of:**
  - 30-day average closing price, OR
  - Previous day's closing price
- All gold must be **benchmarked to 22-carat purity**
- Lower purity gold converted to 22-carat equivalent
- Prices sourced from IBJA or SEBI-regulated commodity exchanges

**Impact Analysis:**
- Historical Context: Pre-2025, banks had 75% LTV throughout tenure; NBFCs only at sanction
- Borrower Benefit: Small-ticket borrowers (rural/semi-urban) can access more funds
- Lender Impact: Tighter monitoring requirements, especially for NBFCs
- Market Uniformity: Eliminates regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs

---

### 1.2 INTEREST RATE REGULATIONS

**Regulatory Framework:**

While the RBI does not directly fix interest rates for gold loans, it mandates:

**Transparency Requirements:**
- Clear disclosure of interest calculation methods
- All charges and fees must be displayed prominently
- Website and branch display mandatory
- No hidden charges permitted
- Prohibition of excessive/usurious interest rates

**Current Market Rates:**
- Typical Range: **7% to 29% annually**
- Varies by: Lender type, borrower profile, loan amount, tenure

**Fair Practices Code Mandates:**
- Interest rates linked to lending costs and risk assessment
- Processing fees, renewal charges, penalty rates must be disclosed upfront
- Board-approved maximum rate caps required (2025 directive to large NBFCs)
- Monthly/quarterly installment structures for non-agricultural loans
- Agricultural loans: Interest charged yearly, coinciding with harvest

**RBI Monetary Policy Influence:**
- Repo rate changes impact gold loan pricing
- Banks typically offer lower rates than NBFCs (due to lower cost of funds)
- NBFCs compensate with faster processing and flexible repayment

---

### 1.3 AUCTION RULES FOR PLEDGED GOLD

**Pre-Auction Requirements:**

**Notice Period:**
- **30-day advance notice** mandatory before auction
- Notice must be in borrower's preferred language
- Sent to borrower and legal heirs
- Must specify: Trigger event, auction date, settlement timeline

**Reserve Price Setting:**
- **First Auction:** Reserve price = 90% of market value
- **If First Auction Fails:** Reserve price drops to 85% of market value
- Market value based on standardized gold price benchmarks

**Auction Procedures:**

Lenders must establish board-approved auction policies covering:
- Trigger events for auction initiation
- Mode of auction (public/e-auction)
- Empanelment of auctioneers
- Timeline specifications
- Procedures for loss of pledged collateral

**Transparency Mandates:**
- Auction details must be publicly available
- Documentation of entire auction process
- Independent witness requirements for illiterate borrowers

**Post-Auction Requirements:**

**Surplus Refund:**
- Any surplus from auction must be returned to borrower
- Timeline: **Within 7 working days** of successful auction
- Surplus = Sale proceeds minus (loan outstanding + accrued interest + charges)

**Borrower Protections:**

- Legal heirs have settlement rights
- Procedure for loss/damage claims

**Key Issues Identified (September 2024 Circular):**
- Lack of transparency in auction processes

**Provisioning Norms:**

While specific gold loan provisioning details are limited in search results, key points include:
- Standard asset provisioning as per NBFC norms
- NPA provisioning: 90 days overdue triggers NPA classification
- Sub-standard, Doubtful, Loss asset categories apply
- Gold collateral value considered in provisioning calculation
- LTV maintenance critical to provisioning requirements

**RBI Supervisory Actions:**

RBI has intensified examination of gold loan NBFCs:

## 4. BANK VS NBFC REGULATORY DIFFERENCES

### 4.1 HISTORICAL DIFFERENCES (PRE-2025)

**Separate Guidelines Created Regulatory Arbitrage:**

**LTV Maintenance:**
- **Banks:** Required to maintain 75% LTV **throughout loan tenure** including accrued interest
- **NBFCs:** Only required LTV compliance **at sanction time** (principal amount only)
- **Impact:** NBFCs had operational advantage; led to LTV breaches during loan life

**Monitoring Frequency:**
- **Banks:** Periodic LTV monitoring mandatory
- **NBFCs:** No explicit ongoing monitoring requirement

**Operational Ambiguity:**
- Different guidelines for banks (banking regulations) and NBFCs (NBFC directions)
- Lack of uniformity in valuation, auction, custody norms

---

### 4.2 2025 HARMONIZATION - UNIFIED FRAMEWORK

**RBI Directions (April 9, 2025):**
- **Reserve Bank of India (Lending Against Gold Collateral) Directions, 2025**
- Objective: Harmonize gold lending across **all regulated entities**
- Applicability: Commercial banks, NBFCs, cooperative banks, housing finance companies

**Key Harmonization Aspects:**

**1. Uniform LTV Norms:**
- Same tiered LTV structure for all (85%/80%/75%)
- Ongoing maintenance requirement for all entities
- LTV includes accrued interest (not just principal)

**2. Unified Gold Valuation:**
- Same 22-carat benchmarking
- Same pricing methodology (30-day avg or previous day, lower value)
- BIS-certified assaying for all

**3. Standardized Bullet Repayment Rules:**
- 12-month cap applies to banks and NBFCs equally
- Renewal/top-up norms uniform

**4. Common Collateral Limits:**
- 1 kg gold ornament limit (all entities)
- 50 grams coin limit (all entities)

**5. Uniform Borrower Protections:**
- 7-day gold return rule (all lenders)
- ₹5,000/day compensation (all lenders)
- 30-day auction notice (all lenders)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Quote from Nuvama Research:**
"The LTV definition has been tightened more for NBFCs than banks. Furthermore, LTV of 75% or less will need to be maintained through the loan life, failing which there will be a penalty."

**Quote from Industry Expert:**
"Banks should be fine as anyway many of them follow these norms. But NBFCs will have to up their act."

**Compliance Cost Implications:**
- NBFCs: Higher initial compliance costs (systems, processes, personnel)
- Banks: Minimal incremental impact (already compliant)
- Mid-tier banks: Some adjustments needed

**Long-term Benefits:**
- Level playing field
- Reduced regulatory arbitrage
- Enhanced asset quality across sector
- Improved risk management
- Market stability and credibility

---

### 4.3 PRIORITY SECTOR LENDING (PSL) DIFFERENCES

**Major Regulatory Distinction Still Exists:**

**Banks:**
- Gold loans for **agricultural purposes** can be classified as PSL
- Conditions:
  - End-use must be for agriculture
  - Continuous monitoring of agricultural end-use required
  - Loan based on scale of finance, not just collateral value
  - Documentation: Land details, crop information, field visit records
  - Hypothecation of crops (if applicable)
- **Exclusion:** Investment in securitization notes backed by gold loans NOT eligible for PSL
- **Exclusion:** Acquisition of NBFC-originated gold loans NOT eligible for PSL

**NBFCs:**
- Gold loans **explicitly excluded** from PSL eligibility
- Even if for agricultural purpose
- NBFC gold loans acquired/securitized by banks also excluded

**Regulatory Rationale:**
- PSL aims to direct institutional credit to vital sectors
- Activity and beneficiary-specific (not collateral-based)
- Banks better positioned to monitor agricultural end-use
- NBFC gold loans typically consumption-oriented

**Updated PSL Guidelines (April 1, 2025):**
- New Priority Sector Lending framework effective
- Agricultural loans up to ₹2 lakh: Collateral and margin waived by banks
- Scale of finance-based assessment prioritized over gold collateral value

---

### 4.4 OPERATIONAL DIFFERENCES

- **Banks:** Multi-day process (2-7 days typical)

**Paperwork:**
- **NBFCs:** Minimal documentation, streamlined processes
- **Banks:** More extensive paperwork, formal procedures

**Customer Accessibility:**
- **NBFCs:** Accessible to customers without banking relationships
- **Banks:** Preference for existing customers

**Interest Rates:**
- **Banks:** Generally lower (7-12% typical) due to lower cost of funds
- **NBFCs:** Higher (12-29% typical) but faster service and flexibility

**Repayment Flexibility:**
- **NBFCs:** More flexible options, frequent renewals
- **Banks:** Stricter repayment schedules

**Branch Network:**
