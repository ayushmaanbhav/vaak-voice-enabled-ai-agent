- **Access Control**:
  - Biometric or key-only access systems
  - Dual control mechanisms for vault access during working hours
  - Keys held by designated branch staff operating within 5 meters of the locker during business hours
- **Surveillance Systems**:
  - Advanced CCTV surveillance systems with state-of-the-art Digital Video Recorders (DVR)
  - High-resolution video images and voice recording capabilities
  - Cloud platform storage for video footage (recommended but remains a challenge for many lenders)
  - Multi-branch simultaneous viewing capability for security monitoring
- **Alarm Systems**: Integrated alarm systems to prevent theft and unauthorized access
- **Detection Systems**: Advanced cameras with vibration, smoke, and heat detection features

#### Storage Protocols
- Gold must be stored **only in secured vaults on the lender's premises**
- Storage handled exclusively by the lender's own employees (not third parties)
- Pledged articles must be:
  - Carefully weighed
  - Marked and sealed in the presence of the customer
  - Stored in gold lockers inside high-security vaults
- Movement of gold between branches permitted only in specific cases with strict internal controls
- Transportation must be secure and timely (no delays)

#### Branch Infrastructure Requirements
- NBFCs must have:
  - Branch network or physical office space for valuation and storage
  - Vaults or safes meeting insurance and security standards
  - Certified gold appraisers to test purity and weight
- Branches **without appropriate storage facilities** should not extend gold loans

### 1.2 Insurance Requirements

#### Mandatory Insurance Coverage
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every NBFC gold loan provider must insure gold stored in its vaults against:
  - Theft and burglary
  - Fire and natural disasters
  - Riots and civil disturbances
  - Any form of loss or damage
- **Coverage Amount**: Insurance must cover the **full value** of the gold stored
- **Lender Responsibility**: Gold loan companies are fully responsible for pledged gold articles
- **Customer Protection**: To protect customers' assets, RBI mandates that lenders insure all pledged gold

#### Insurance Acquisition Options
- **Add-on Service**: Many banks and NBFCs offer insurance as an add-on when taking the gold loan
- **Lender Tie-ups**: Most financial institutions have tie-ups with specific insurance companies offering group coverage
- **Borrower Choice**: Some lenders allow borrowers to choose their own insurer (subject to lender approval)

#### Claims and Compensation
- Any collateral loss or damage must be:
  - Recorded and disclosed
  - Compensated by the lender
  - Include repair costs if damage occurs during the loan period
- In case of unfortunate incidents (burglary, misplacement, fire, natural calamity):
  - Lender must pay according to the property's value
  - Compensation clause must be reflected in gold loan documents
- Insurance pays the outstanding loan amount to the lending institution to fulfill borrower repayment obligations

#### Notable Industry Data

### 1.3 Security Incidents and Regulatory Response

#### Fraud and Irregularities
- **Employee Collusion (2021)**: NBFC employees colluded with appraisers to misappropriate pledged gold worth crores
- **Online Fraud**: Multiple FIRs against fraudulent entities promising gold loans online and vanishing with pledged ornaments
- **Improper Auctions**: Court interventions where NBFCs auctioned pledged gold without proper statutory notice

#### Security Challenges Identified
1. **Key Management Risk**: Necessity to open lockers frequently creates vulnerability as keys are held by branch staff
2. **Limited Surveillance**: Inability to view multiple branches simultaneously
3. **Cloud Storage Gap**: Absence of cloud platforms for video footage storage
4. **Third-Party Risks**: Gold stored in Business Correspondent (BC) custody, delayed and insecure transportation
