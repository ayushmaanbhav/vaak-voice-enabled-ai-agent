# IIFL Finance Gold Loan Crisis and RBI Action 2024 - Comprehensive Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

In March 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a complete ban on IIFL Finance's gold loan operations, marking one of the most significant regulatory actions against an NBFC in recent years.

## 1. RBI ACTION DETAILS

### 1.1 What Exactly Did RBI Do to IIFL?

On **March 4, 2024**, the RBI issued an immediate order prohibiting IIFL Finance from:
- Sanctioning new gold loans
- Disbursing approved gold loans
- Assignment of gold loan portfolio
- Securitization of gold loans
- Sale of gold loan assets

**Scope of Ban:**
- Applied to all gold loan operations across 2,775 branches
- Portfolio size affected: Rs 24,692 crore (32% of total AUM)
- Customer base: 1.9 million gold loan customers
- However, IIFL was permitted to:
  - Service existing gold loan portfolio
  - Continue loan collections and recoveries
  - Maintain other business operations (non-gold loan products)

### 1.2 Reasons Cited by RBI

The RBI inspection (based on financial position as of March 31, 2023) revealed **"material supervisory concerns"** across multiple areas:

#### A. Gold Valuation Irregularities
- **Serious deviations** in assaying and certifying purity and net weight of gold at time of loan sanction
- **Discrepancies at auction**: Differences in gold valuation between loan origination and default auction
- **Shocking statistics**: Out of 82,000 gold loans that went to auction, **67% (55,000 cases)** showed discrepancies between gold value and loan amount offered
- **Customer absence**: Valuation of gold conducted without customer presence

#### B. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Breaches
- Multiple instances of exceeding the regulatory LTV ceiling of 75%
- **Weak monitoring systems**: Lack of robust systems for periodical LTV monitoring
- **Ignored alerts**: System-generated alerts for LTV breaches not actively pursued
- Inadequate corrective action when breaches occurred

#### C. Cash Transaction Violations
- **Significant disbursements** in cash far exceeding statutory limits
- Previous practice: Disbursing up to **Rs 2 lakh in cash**
- Regulatory limit: **Rs 20,000** (Section 269SS of Income Tax Act, 1961)
- Similarly excessive cash collections observed

#### D. Auction Process Non-Compliance
- **Non-adherence to standard auction process**
- Lack of transparency in auction procedures
- Auction locations not accessible to borrowers
- Improper documentation and process adherence

#### E. Lack of Customer Transparency
- **Lack of transparency in charges** being levied to customer accounts
- Hidden fees and unclear pricing structures
- Inadequate disclosure of total cost of borrowing

#### F. Partnership and Fintech Issues
For loans granted through Fintech entities/Business Correspondents (BC):
- Credit appraisal and valuation done by BC itself (conflict of interest)
- Gold stored in custody of BC (security risk)
- Delayed and insecure transportation of gold to branches
- KYC compliance done through Fintechs (regulatory concern)
- Use of internal accounts for disbursement and repayment

#### G. Asset Quality Concerns
- **Non-categorization of gold loans as NPA** in the system
- **Evergreening practices**: Renewing overdue loans or issuing fresh loans to cover delinquencies
- Top-up loans granted to cover existing loan delinquencies
- Inadequate monitoring by Senior Management and Board
- Absence of controls over third-party entities

### 1.3 RBI's Assessment

**Critical Quote from RBI:**
"These practices, apart from being regulatory violations, also significantly and adversely impact the interest of the customers. However, no meaningful corrective action has been evidenced so far."

The RBI emphasized that despite months of engagement with senior management and statutory auditors, **no meaningful corrective action was demonstrated**, leading to the drastic ban.
