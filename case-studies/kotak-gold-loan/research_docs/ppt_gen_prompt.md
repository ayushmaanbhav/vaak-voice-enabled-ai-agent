understand and create a beautiful and executive presentation deck based on the file "thread_7.prompt_1.Kotak_Gold_Loan_Comprehensive_Strategy_Report.md",
 
use your best skills ,  mind and creativity, 
use best skills for modelling  and showcasing the content according to its nature as used by experts based on first principles, making it smartly aso its easy and quick to read and understand. 
create images and infographics where needed , use charts, styling, comparisons, stories, infographics, etc
understand , analyse and highlight required content and metrics, summarise and consolidate where required,
remember the original objective to come up with personalised pitch plan and messaging / targeting / conversion strategies and execution plan for kotaks customer base and remember content and metrics to prioritise accordingly
content like bridge loans, doorstep pilot and personalised pitch plan and messaging / targeting / conversion strategies and execution plan based on customer category / parameters (like customers who have switched before) are really good sections
create atleast multiple slides per section / subsection and more where required , we'll shorten the ppt afterwards as required, keep code modular accordingly
pay least attention to investment costs and include only necessary cost analysis where you this its required or should be presented or mentioned - like for doorstep and overall cost analysis it would be great
also consolidate unimportant sections were required, remember the original goals


IMPORTANT:
it should potray to the kotak leadership and showcase our hardwork of how much extensive research we have done! if you see other files (list in cwd/*.md files, dont read them, dont read from the kotak-gold-loan-presentation or .old folders as well), you'll see we have even studied other countries for innovations.



deep dive and use your best creativity and analysis. take all resources required, do web search if required,
debate and find ambiguities, ask me where required and where you think my opinion will help make it better and awesome,
go into plan mode and create a detailed implementation strategy and tasks
use agents to perform tasks where possible and give them suficient context to perform them with best of ability
use bigger fonts and multiple slides, use ample space and dont leave empty space, spread out.



before we create a react app
"lets first come up and write full details of the content", create a separate folder and use file per slide!! it should be aganostic 
of the final implementation method (react or latex, etc)

create content files as required, (image files etc)
