### Objectives
Read, understand, analyze all gathered research data and generate a multi-layered Product Strategy Report and come up with innovative approaches to pitch personalised Kotak Gold Loan offerings to Kotak's existing customers in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities who currently hold active gold loans with NBFC giants like Muthoot Finance, Manappuram, or IIFL.

### Task: Research Synthesis & Strategy Generation
1. Analysis of Research.
2. Acquisition Strategy.
3. AI-Driven Solutions: Propose 3 high-impact AI features to streamline the lifecycle:
   - Computer Vision for instant preliminary appraisal via the existing Kotak's mobile app.
   - Predictive Acquisition: Using bank transaction data to identify customers paying interest to competitors.
   - "THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT POINT" : Potential use of AI to identify customer base who are most probable to switch to Kotak or would be best users to pitch the gold loan. Also we can use AI to pitch personalised gold loans based on different parameters like age-group, credit score, financial activity, risk taking capacity, loan count and amount taken before, age-group, gender, customer_type (msme / peronal) , demographics, psychology, etc.

### Constraints & Structure
Inputs: Tone: Strategic, data-driven, and persuasive for a C-suite pitch.

### Self-Check (Reasoning)
Before providing the final strategy, think step-by-step: Why would a Muthoot / Manappuram customer move their gold to Kotak? Is the interest saving enough to overcome the friction of moving physical collateral? How to gain trust through personalisation pitch, use incentives, ease and psychology? How can AI reduce this friction? etc , formulate and ask other questions as well. create agents and debate from different perspectives and approaches,  communicate on this then formulate the final report. Ask questions to me where ambuigity.


use plan mode and multi agents and multiple stages debate and drive decision then debate again if required and include me as well in debate if there is ambuigity or you need my opinion.
